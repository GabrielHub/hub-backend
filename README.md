A comprehensive glossary and analytics hub for 2K data, built with Firebase, Express, React, and Node.

What can you do with it?
1. Generate and view advanced data using NBA analytics (equations from basketball reference)
2. Compare and rank players by statistic
3. Compare to NBA players, leveraging data from the NBA website/api

### How to deploy
- `cd hub-backend/functions`
- `firebase deploy --only functions` to deploy backend to prod
- 
- `npm run build` => `firebase functions:shell` to run the emulator

You can test functions by adding the function to the `testFunctions` endpoint
`app.get('/testFunctions')`
